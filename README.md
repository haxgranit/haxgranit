# Granit Haxhaj: Ruby on Rails Full Stack Developer

Hello, world! I'm Granit, a passionate Software Engineer hailing from the heart of Texas. With a foundation in Economics from Fordham University, I've ventured deep into the realms of web development and data management. My expertise allows me to craft intricate solutions for companies navigating the challenges of large databases and intricate full-stack web applications.

## üöÄ Projects & Experience:
Theater Engine:
Dived deep into the world of theater, constructing the project's infrastructure using docker containers. These containers play host to a myriad of components, including a Rails server, PostgreSQL database, Sidekiq, Elasticsearch, and more. The project boasts multiple MVC architectural components, such as Albums, Festivals, Media, Theaters, and Users.

FileMaker Pro 19.4 & FMS 19.1:
Collaborated with BesVinyl, LLC, crafting an automated data warehouse management platform. This platform is a harmonious blend of FileMaker Server/Script Schedules, WebDirect, and fresh UI layouts. The tech stack includes Shopify Admin, Storefront APIs, and the FileMaker Data API.

E-commerce Platforms:
Crafted online shopping platforms centered around POS systems like Square, EPOS, and LightSpeed. My toolkit includes QR scanning capabilities, loyalty system integrations, and features like pre-order, booking, and recharge subscription. I've also developed data warehouse and inventory add-ons. A notable highlight is my familiarity with BigCommerce APIs (V2, V3), Storefront API, and GraphQL. I've refined the adapter dataflow using the GraphQL Storefront API, optimizing data queries from within a Stencil theme or remote site.

Recharge Payments:
As a full-stack maestro, I contributed to the Recharge Payments project, birthing the Recharge Adapter. Recognized as the top subscription app on the Shopify App Store, this adapter extends Recharge‚Äôs functionality to platforms like BigCommerce and potentially Magento, WooCommerce, and others. This extension is achieved through meticulous API backend development paired with a vibrant Javascript Vue front-end.
