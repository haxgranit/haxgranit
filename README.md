# Granit Haxhaj: Ruby on Rails Full Stack Developer

Hello, world! I'm Granit, a passionate Software Engineer hailing from the heart of Texas. With a foundation in Economics from Fordham University, I've ventured deep into the realms of web development and data management. My expertise allows me to craft intricate solutions for companies navigating the challenges of large databases and intricate full-stack web applications.

## üöÄ Projects & Experience:
#### Theater Engine:
Dived deep into the world of theater, constructing the project's infrastructure using docker containers. These containers play host to a myriad of components, including a Rails server, PostgreSQL database, Sidekiq, Elasticsearch, and more. The project boasts multiple MVC architectural components, such as Albums, Festivals, Media, Theaters, and Users.

FileMaker Pro 19.4 & FMS 19.1:
Collaborated with BesVinyl, LLC, crafting an automated data warehouse management platform. This platform is a harmonious blend of FileMaker Server/Script Schedules, WebDirect, and fresh UI layouts. The tech stack includes Shopify Admin, Storefront APIs, and the FileMaker Data API.

#### E-commerce Platforms:
Crafted online shopping platforms centered around POS systems like Square, EPOS, and LightSpeed. My toolkit includes QR scanning capabilities, loyalty system integrations, and features like pre-order, booking, and recharge subscription. I've also developed data warehouse and inventory add-ons. A notable highlight is my familiarity with BigCommerce APIs (V2, V3), Storefront API, and GraphQL. I've refined the adapter dataflow using the GraphQL Storefront API, optimizing data queries from within a Stencil theme or remote site.

#### Recharge Payments:
As a full-stack maestro, I contributed to the Recharge Payments project, birthing the Recharge Adapter. Recognized as the top subscription app on the Shopify App Store, this adapter extends Recharge‚Äôs functionality to platforms like BigCommerce and potentially Magento, WooCommerce, and others. This extension is achieved through meticulous API backend development paired with a vibrant Javascript Vue front-end.

#### Devise with OmniAuth:
A leading e-commerce platform wanted to provide its users with the ability to sign in using their Google or Facebook accounts. They chose Devise with OmniAuth due to its extensive support for various authentication strategies and its seamless integration with Ruby on Rails.

Technical Solution:

	‚Ä¢ Integration: Utilized the Devise gem for user authentication and added OmniAuth for third-party authentication.
	‚Ä¢ Protocols: Supported OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook integrations.
	‚Ä¢ Implementation: Configured OmniAuth strategies for Google and Facebook in the Devise initializer.
	‚Ä¢ RBAC: Used CanCanCan gem in conjunction with Devise to handle role-based access control.
 	‚Ä¢ Security: Implemented token validation and ensured secure storage of tokens.

#### Okta with Ruby on Rails:
A healthcare startup wanted a secure and scalable SSO solution for its patient portal and staff applications. They selected Okta due to its robust security features and comprehensive developer documentation for Ruby on Rails.

Technical Solution:

	‚Ä¢ Integration: Incorporated the Okta Ruby SDK to connect the Rails application with Okta's identity cloud.
	‚Ä¢ Protocols: Supported OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for a range of third-party integrations.
	‚Ä¢ Implementation: Configured Okta's inline hooks to customize the authentication and registration flows.
	‚Ä¢ RBAC: Used Okta's Groups and API Access Management features to implement role-based access control.
	‚Ä¢ Security: Leveraged Okta's Adaptive MFA and threat insights for enhanced security.
